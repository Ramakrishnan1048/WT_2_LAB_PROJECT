A platform where users can code and improve their coding skills. The project recommends the next question for the user to try out. Each user can submit any number of time until the code is accepted.

The backend is developed using Flask, and the frontend using Vue.
Predictive fetch is used to display the recommendations and list all the available questions.
REST APIs are used to implement the back end functionality.

To start the server run: python app.py
In case of issues, delete the users.db file and run: python create_database.py

The flask app runs in development mode, and must be made production ready before deployment.
