Given a string S with repeated characters (only lowercase). The task is to rearrange characters in a string such that no two adjacent characters are same.

Note : It may be assumed that the string has only lowercase English alphabets.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains a single line containing a string of lowercase english alphabets.

Output:
For each test case in a new line print "1" (without quotes) if the generated string doesn't contains any same adjacent characters, else if no such string is possible to be made print "0" (without quotes).
